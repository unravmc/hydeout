Our goal across all of our platforms is to make sure that everyone has an enjoyable environment to experience. We have a list of rules that all of our members are asked to follow. By using our in-game Minecraft server, our community forum or Discord server, you are agreeing to abide by these rules.

We try to keep all of our platforms clean, without a hostile playing environment. All of our rules are designed to be simple and to stick, but to cover the basics of what we expect from all of our members. Help make the community better by knowing what’s expected.

## Golden rule

<hr>

### 1. Comply with staff members
Comply with all of the requests of staff members, and be truthful and forthcoming with anything they might ask.

<details>
  <summary>Why have this rule?</summary>
      <p>The goal of staff members is to keep the community a safe place and promote an enjoyable experience for all of our members. When everyone cooperates with staff members, they are better able to keep the community secure.</p>
      <p>Staff members will never ask for personal information or any credentials to your account. File a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/report">report</a> immediately if this happens.</p>

<details>
  <summary>What exactly does this rule mean?</summary>
      <p>All of our staff members act with the whole community in mind. Try to assist by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer their questions or recall any events you remember</li>
          <li>Remaining truthful</li>
          <li>Actively reporting rule-breaking behavior</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Some things don’t help our staff members, however. Try to avoid the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Mini-modding, trying to enforce rules for other staff members. Try to direct staff members to the rule-breaking behavior</li>
          <li>Withholding details from staff members</li>
          <li>Filing appeals or reports on behalf of someone else</li>
          <li>Evading punishments issued by staff members</li>
        </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who is a staff member?</summary>
      <p>All staff members can be located by the prefix before their name:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Executives will have a <span style="color: #515a5a">[</span><span style="color: #cb4335">Exec</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #e74c3c">light red</span> name.</li>
