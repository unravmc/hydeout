Our goal across all of our platforms is to make sure that everyone has an enjoyable environment to experience. We have a list of rules that all of our members are asked to follow. By using our in-game Minecraft server, our community forum or Discord server, you are agreeing to abide by these rules.

We try to keep all of our platforms clean, without a hostile playing environment. All of our rules are designed to be simple and to stick, but to cover the basics of what we expect from all of our members. Help make the community better by knowing what’s expected.

## Golden rule

### 1. Comply with staff members
Comply with all of the requests of staff members, and be truthful and forthcoming with anything they might ask.
