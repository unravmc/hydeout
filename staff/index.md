All of our staff members are responsible for appropriately moderating and conducting our community in a professional way. Every member of our team is chosen to be a supportive member of the server; to keep the server open, and available to everyone. Our staff members serve the members, and everyone has the right to get in contact with those in charge.

These members are the “bosses” of the server. Anyone of these members holds the same abilities as the next and can make the final decisions. They approve and deny applications, can appoint or remove Developers and modify files on the server. They have every permission on the server, management panel, forum, and guild. These users manage services for the server as well, including voting websites and emails. They are able to suspend any member of staff.

These members are users who code our plugins or maintain the ones that are deployed on the server. They have access to every permission on the server and are granted additional permissions on the management panel.
