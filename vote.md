When you vote for the server, you’ll receive perks from voting in-game immediately! It's a great way to show your support for the server and to have more fun, all at zero cost!

Voting helps new players find the server, and by voting you are showing your support. No vote for us is a wasted vote.

## Where to vote
We offer four different sites where you can vote for and show your support for the server. Each site will grant all perks for six hours each, and voting on all four will grant them for the day. Vote every day to make sure you keep your perks and special rank!
